# Payment_Application
This APP like you have withdraw money from a bank.
it is devided to 3 main repos 
  1. Card (which get the card data through eg: Name, Expiry date and PAN).
  2. Terminal (which get transaction data eg: Transaction date, Transaction Amount, Max Transaction Amount and know in this if the card expired or not).
  3. Server (which like the bank itself as it has the customer data and validate it).
  
it has App repo which connect all of these function to gether (kind of abstraction) and save thet ransaction data.
it has also the main file which runs the appStart func.

Have alook ;)
